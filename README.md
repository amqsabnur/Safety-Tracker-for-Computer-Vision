# Safety Tracker: Enhancing Nighttime Security for Women

This project introduces an advanced algorithm empowered by artificial intelligence, capable of dynamically detecting and tracking instances of potential stalking or harassment in real-time, even in low-light environments. Designed to enhance safety for women at night, it vigilantly monitors their surroundings, promptly alerting them to any looming dangers.

## Demo.mp4 has the demo video of how the tracker works
  - It draws a black box around a human when it detect that person for the first time
  - The black box becomes red when the person has been there for a long time
  - The black box also becomes red when a person detected previous dissapears and reappears in the user's surrounding√ü

### Motivation
**Issue**: Women and young girls often experience street harassment, ranging from catcalls to assault.
**Existing Solutions**: Current safety apps have limited functionality, such as scream detection or manual activation by holding a button in the app

**Proposal**: I aimed to develop a product that automatically detects threats, such as someone following you for an extended period.

### Diving into Technical Details
This safety tracking algorithm uses Computer Vision.

This Computer Vision algorithm combines YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and DeepSORT for object tracking.

#### YOLOv5: Real-time Object Detection:
  - YOLO (You Only Look Once) v5 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm.
  - It employs a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation.
  - This allows for efficient and accurate detection of unique objects in real-time, crucial for identifying potential threats quickly.

Architecture of the model is shown below:

#### DeepSORT: Object tracking algorithm based on deep learning.
  - DeepSORT (Deep Learning for Object Tracking) is an advanced algorithm designed for tracking objects in video streams.
  - It utilizes deep learning techniques to associate object detections over multiple frames, enabling robust and accurate tracking of moving objects.
  - By combining YOLOv5's object detection with DeepSORT's tracking capabilities, the system can not only detect but also track potential threats, providing continuous surveillance and ensuring timely alerts in dynamic environments.

#### Image Similarity
  - Next identify unique features in images and assign them numerical descriptions.
  - By comparing these descriptions between different images, you can track individuals over time, helping the slgorithm to spot any potential threats.
