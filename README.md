# Safety Tracker: Enhancing Nighttime Security for Women

Developed a project to "see" and recognize objects in real-time, even in the dark. It's designed to help improve safety for women at night by keeping track of what's happening around them and alerting to any potential dangers.


Developed a Computer Vision algorithm combining YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and DeepSORT for object tracking.
Focuses on improving safety measures during nighttime hours.
